This repository contains the library of shared classes and methods used by both the official server and the client.

For more information on the TrainLink API, [see the main repository](https://github.com/trainlink-org/trainlink-api). Alternatively, to download and use it go to the [main website](trainlink-org.github.io).

## Usage

This library probably isn't useful for anyone other than those working on the official client and server, unless you particularly want to use one of the classes for your own client or server.
If this is the case, it can be installed via npm with the following command:

```bash
$ npm install @trainlink-org/shared-lib
```
